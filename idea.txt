The whole idea is to have a social website, where random people from the same country(origin) can meet/socialize/interact in a different random country

Example, 5 random people from Germany or South Africa finding themselves in France, Canada or USA becaouse of different reasons, say holiday, education(Students), work, business trip etc

What problem im trying to solve, 
Lonelyness/stigmatization when someone travels off country, They have no idea of the visited location, language, have no friends, unfamiliar foods, music

In this website, we have people in a new country, they share the same country of origin. 
This means they share the samesomeone

Someone can know where, they share the same music taste, food, Language hence easy adaptability to the new environment with ease.
