The whole idea is to have a social website, where people from different countries can meet/socialize/interact in the same country

Example, 5 random people from germany finding themselves in france becasue of different reasons, say holiday, education, work

What problem im trying to solve, 
Lonelyness/stigmatization when someone travels off country, THey have no idea of the visited location, language, have no friends, unfamiliar foods, music

In this website, we have people in a new country, they share the same country of origin. 
This means they share the samesomeone

Someone can know where, they share the same music taste, food, Language hence easy adaptability to the new environment with no problem
