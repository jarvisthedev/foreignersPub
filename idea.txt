Foreigners pub is a social platform that aims to improve the social connection between foreigners sharing the same native country

What problem im trying to solve, 
Loneliness when someone travels off country, They have no idea of the visited location, language, have no friends, unfamiliar foods, music

Example, 4 random people from Germany or South Africa finding themselves in France, Canada or USA because of different reasons, say holiday, health, education, work, business trip. These people could easily connect among themselves than with people in their current residence.
